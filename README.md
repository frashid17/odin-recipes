# odin-recipes

My name is Patrick Mwangi and I am getting started with odin project as a platform to learn about website design
so far so good i know about basic bash commands, how to use the terminal which i had no idea from before what it did or
why it was there in the first place.
i had a bit of knowledge on some programming languages before i started using Odin project like C++, basics of Java Script , C++ and some basics
of python

At the end of this Odin project course i want to be able to make a full responsive website with ease 

this site i am making right now is basically a recipe and i am getting instructions from Odin project
